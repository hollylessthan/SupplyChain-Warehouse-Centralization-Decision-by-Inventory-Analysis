# SupplyChain-Warehouse-Centralization-Decision-by-Inventory-Analysis

This is a course project from the Supply Chain Analytics course at UCSD, and the data set is obtained from the course as well. The goal of this project is to decide whether the company should centralize their warehouses by analyzing its inventory and annual costs.

#### Language
Python 3.8.5 (default, Jul 28 2020, 12:59:40) 

#### Context

The ALKO company case and its current situation could be found in the ALKO_case.pdf file. It currently own 4 warehouses at different location in the US. The company would like to know whether moving all its inventory to a national warehouse is profitable.

I started the analysis by calculating the average inventory at each of the four current warehouses and summarized the total costs for the four locations.
I then calculated if the company used a centralized location, what would be its required average inventory and annual total costs.


#### Result

By comparing the annual total cost of all the four loctions and the annual total cost of the national warehouse, I found the company could save $1833.85 annually by centralization.
